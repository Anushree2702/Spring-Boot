# Spring-Boot
Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of building production-ready, stand-alone applications in Java. It takes the complexity out of configuring a Spring application by providing sensible defaults and a wide range of pre-built configurations, allowing developers to focus on writing code instead of setting up the environment.
<h4>
Key Features of Spring Boot:
</h4>
<h5>
Auto-configuration:
</h5>

Spring Boot automatically configures many aspects of the application based on the dependencies included in the project. For example, if you have a dependency for a database, Spring Boot will auto-configure data sources, connection pools, and more.

<h5>Embedded Servers:</h5>

Spring Boot includes embedded web servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, so you don't need to deploy your application to an external server. You can simply run your Spring Boot application as a stand-alone Java application.
This allows you to package the application as a JAR file with the embedded server, making deployment easier.
<h5>Opinionated Defaults:</h5>

Spring Boot provides sensible defaults for application configurations, but these can be overridden if needed. This helps reduce the amount of boilerplate code you have to write.
<h5>Microservices-Ready:</h5>

Spring Boot is commonly used to create microservices because it provides the ability to develop and run small, independent services with minimal configuration. The framework includes features like Spring Cloud for building robust microservice architectures.
<h5>Starter Dependencies:</h5>

Spring Boot uses starter dependencies to group commonly used libraries and configurations. For example, adding spring-boot-starter-web to your project brings in all the necessary dependencies for creating a web application, like Spring MVC and an embedded Tomcat server.
<h5>Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface):</h5>

A command-line tool that allows you to quickly prototype Spring applications using Groovy or Java without requiring an IDE setup.
<h5>Spring Boot Actuator:</h5>

Provides built-in tools for monitoring and managing Spring Boot applications in production. It includes features like health checks, metrics, environment info, and more, which can be accessed via REST endpoints.
<h5>Simplified Dependency Management:</h5>

Spring Boot manages the versions of the dependencies for you by providing a predefined set of libraries and their compatible versions. This reduces the complexity of managing library versions and ensures stability.
<h1>
IoC (Inversion of Control)</h1> is a fundamental principle in the Spring Framework that helps manage the instantiation and lifecycle of objects (beans). Instead of the application code controlling the flow of the program and managing dependencies directly, the control is inverted. Spring achieves this primarily through the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern.
<h3>
Key Concepts of IoC in Spring:
Inversion of Control (IoC):</h3>

In a traditional application, the application code creates its dependencies directly. With IoC, the control of object creation and management is transferred to the Spring container.
This means that the Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of beans.
<h5>Dependency Injection (DI):</h5>

DI is a design pattern used to implement IoC. Instead of a class creating its dependencies, they are "injected" into the class, usually through constructor or setter methods.
This promotes loose coupling, making it easier to manage, test, and maintain code.
<h5>Spring Container:</h5>

The Spring container is responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of Spring beans, including instantiation, dependency resolution, configuration, and destruction.
There are different types of Spring containers, with the most commonly used being the ApplicationContext.
<h4>Types of Dependency Injection:</h4>
<h5>Constructor Injection:</h5>

Dependencies are provided through the class constructor.

@Component
public class EmployeeService {
    private final EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @Autowired
    public EmployeeService(EmployeeRepository employeeRepository) {
        this.employeeRepository = employeeRepository;
    }
}
<h5>Setter Injection:</h5>


@Component
public class EmployeeService {
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @Autowired
    public void setEmployeeRepository(EmployeeRepository employeeRepository) {
        this.employeeRepository = employeeRepository;
    }
}
<h5>Field Injection (not recommended):</h5>

Dependencies are injected directly into fields using annotations, but this approach makes unit testing difficult and does not promote immutability.

@Component
public class EmployeeService {
    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;
}

<h3>Advantages of IoC and DI in Spring:</h3>
<h4>>Loose Coupling:</h4>

Classes are less dependent on concrete implementations, which makes it easier to switch implementations or mock dependencies for testing.
<h4>Easier Testing:</h4>

Dependencies can be mocked or stubbed during unit tests, allowing for more isolated and efficient testing.
<h5>Centralized Configuration:</h5>

Dependencies can be configured in a centralized manner, usually through configuration files or annotations, making management easier.
<h5>Lifecycle Management:</h5>

The Spring container manages the lifecycle of beans, including instantiation, configuration, and destruction, reducing boilerplate code.
<h5>Example of IoC in Spring:</h5>
Hereâ€™s a simple example illustrating IoC using Spring:

<h5>Define the Service and Repository:</h5>


@Service
public class EmployeeService {
    private final EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @Autowired
    public EmployeeService(EmployeeRepository employeeRepository) {
        this.employeeRepository = employeeRepository;
    }

    public void performService() {
        // Business logic here
    }
}

@Repository
public class EmployeeRepository {
    public void save() {
        // Logic to save employee
    }
}

<h4>Spring Configuration: You can use Java-based configuration to enable component scanning and register your beans:</h4>


@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
public class AppConfig {
}
<h4>Run the Application: In your main application class, create an application context and get the bean:</h4>


public class MainApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        EmployeeService employeeService = context.getBean(EmployeeService.class);
        employeeService.performService();
    }
}
<h3>
Conclusion:
</h3>
Inversion of Control (IoC) in Spring allows for more modular, maintainable, and testable code by managing the dependencies and lifecycles of beans through Dependency Injection. This promotes loose coupling and better organization within an application, making it a key feature of the Spring Framework.
